### Project Description :In a college ecosystem rich with talent but limited by financial resources, we identified the need for a collaborative, non-monetary skill exchange platform — and thus, SkillSwap was born. SkillSwap is a smart, gamified Skill Barter System designed specifically for college students to teach, learn, and grow by exchanging skills like design, coding, music, public speaking, and more.
Our idea evolved from the simple notion of peer learning into an engaging, student-centric platform powered by AI-based matchmaking, gamification, and skill-chain bartering, where students can participate in multi-way exchanges when direct matches aren’t available.
Built with a React Native front-end and Flask backend using firebase as the database , SkillSwap includes features like smart scheduling, student leaderboards, review systems, skill portfolios, and real-time group learning circles — making it not only useful and necessary for campus communities but also a powerful tool for students to build portfolios, grow confidence, and form meaningful academic networks.
In short, it's LinkedIn meets Duolingo, purpose-built for college life — all without the money barrier.
